title: "Lean Project"
---

Welcome! On this website you can find all the information regarding the Lean Project assignment. The assignment is divided into five different steps. Start by reading the "Background & Aim" page to learn more about the goal of this assignment, after which you can go to "Step 1: Getting Started". All the necessary materials (readings, videos) are listed on the "Materials" page. 

**Important**: It is highly likely that you have little to no experience with entrepreneurship, startups, or new business development. That is not a problem, but it does mean that you will have to spend some time understanding some of the central concepts (e.g., business model). Each of the different steps requires you to do some upfront reading where these concepts are explained in detail. We do not have the time to discuss the readings in detail in class, so this is something you have to prepare on your own.
