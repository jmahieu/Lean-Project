<p>Now that you have a good understanding of the problem, the next step
is to create a demo or prototype of your solution (i.e., a prototype of
your product).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Key question: Do I have a solution that creates significant customer
value?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above statement is also called <a

fit”</a>. In the solution phase of the assignment, you are testing the
following risks:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Customer risk: Who has the pain? (Early Adopters)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>How do you identify early adopters?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Product risk: How will you solve these problems?
(Solution)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>What is the minimum feature set needed to launch?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Market risk: What is the pricing model? (Revenue
Streams)</em></li>

<p>Will customers pay for a solution? What price will they bear?</p>

<h2>A. Define Your Value Proposition</h2>
<p>A good product is designed with focus on the set of needs that are
important and that make sense to address together. A typical mistake
made by first-time entrepreneurs is trying to add too many features to
their products from the beginning. This is usually a waste of valuable
resources and makes it also harder to test your value proposition
hypothesis. A clear value proposition decreases the likelihood that you
are just launching a “me too” product, focuses your resources on what’s
most important, and increases your chances of success.</p>
<p>Relying on the information from your problem interviews of the
previous step, you can define your value proposition. To define your
value proposition use the template below (cf., Table 5.4 on page 73 of
the <a
href="https://github.com/jmahieu/Lean-Project/raw/main/The%20Lean%20Product%20Playbook%20-%202015%20-%20Olsen.pdf">The
Lean Product Playbook</a> ). See <a
href="https://github.com/jmahieu/Lean-Project/raw/main/The%20Lean%20Product%20Playbook%20-%202015%20-%20Olsen.pdf">Chapter
5</a> of the Lean Product Playbook on how to create your value
proposition.</p>

<p class="caption">
Value Proposition Template
</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Must-Haves</strong> are features that need to be
incorporated into your product for customers to be satisfied with it.
<em>Not</em> incorporating this feature would cause customer
dissatisfaction, while incorporating them does not necessarily generate
satisfaction (E.g., not incorporating seatbelts in a car would cause
substantial dissatisfaction).</p></li>
<li><p>With <strong>performance benefits</strong>, more is better. As
the need is more fully met, the resulting customer satisfaction
increases. For performance benefits, you should use whatever scale works
best for you: A scale of “High,” “Medium,” and “Low” usually works
well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Delighters</strong> provide unexpected benefits that
exceed customer expectations, resulting in very high customer
satisfaction. The absence of a delighter doesn’t cause any
dissatisfaction because customers aren’t expecting it. Delighters are
typically unique, so just list each delighter on a separate row and then
mark “Yes” where applicable.</p></li>

class="section level2">
<h2>B. Specify Your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Feature Set</h2>
<p>Now that you have a clear understanding of your value proposition,
the next step is to decide on the feature set for your <a
href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html">Minimum
Viable Product (MVP)</a> candidate. You are not going to start off by
designing a new product that delivers on your full value proposition,
since that would take too long and be too risky. For your MVP, you want
to identify the minimum functionality required to validate that you are
heading in the right direction.</p>
<p><em>Individually</em>, brainstorm about as many feature ideas as you
can for how your product could deliver that benefit. You should be
practicing divergent thinking, which means trying to generate as many
ideas as possible without any judgment or evaluation. <em>User
stories</em> (used in Agile development) are a great way to write your
feature ideas to make sure that the corresponding customer benefit
remains clear. See page 78 of <a
href="https://github.com/jmahieu/Lean-Project/raw/main/The%20Lean%20Product%20Playbook%20-%202015%20-%20Olsen.pdf">The
Lean Product Playbook</a> ) on how to create user stories.</p>
<p>Next, as a <em>team</em> decide on which features you want to retain:
you need to incorporate <strong>at least 1</strong> feature for each
benefit/delighter of the value proposition. Match all the features to a
particular benefit, and prioritize them. Now you need to make some tough
decision on which features you want to keep. To start with, your MVP
candidate needs to have all the must-haves you’ve identified. After
that, you should focus on the main performance benefit you’re planning
to use to beat the competition. You should select the set of feature
chunks for this benefit that you believe will provide enough for
customers to see the difference in your product. Delighters are part of
your differentiation, too. You should include your top delighter in your
MVP candidate. That may not be necessary if you have a very large
advantage on a performance benefit. The goal is to make sure that your
MVP candidate includes something that customers find superior to others
products and, ideally, unique.</p>
<p>See Figure 6.3 on page 85 of <a
href="https://github.com/jmahieu/Lean-Project/raw/main/The%20Lean%20Product%20Playbook%20-%202015%20-%20Olsen.pdf">The

<ul>
<li>Update your “Value Proposition” document adding an extra column
where you match the retained features to the corresponding benefits. In
case you have more than one feature per benefit, add more columns
keeping the most important feature in the most left column.</li>
</ul>

<div id="c.-create-your-mvp-prototype" class="section level2">
<h2>C. Create your MVP Prototype</h2>
<p>When you have decided on the features of your <a
href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html">Minimum
Viable Product</a>, it is time to actually start creating your first
prototype! Remember, the goal is to test your hypothesis that your
product will help solving your customer’s problem. You do not want to
build a finished and functional product at this point. You want to build
just enough of the solution that you can put in front of customers for
the purpose of measuring their reaction and further defining the
requirements for your minimum viable product (MVP).</p>
<p>As you can see in the picture below, there are many ways to test
this. For this assignment, we will use one type of qualitative test
called a <strong>“mockup”</strong>. Mockups convey visual design details
such as colors, fonts, and images. Some are intended to be “pixel
perfect” while others may only represent the approximate size and
position of design elements. Mockups are also sometimes referred to as
“comps,” and are usually created with a graphic design application such
as Illustrator, Photoshop, or Sketch. You may also want to check out <a
href="https://uizard.io/">uizard</a> if you are creating an app. Read
pages 104-105 of the <a

<h2>D. Test Your Solution</h2>
<p>When you have created your MVP prototype, it is time to test it with
customers. Preferably, do this with the same people you interviewed
before. You should have received permission to follow up from your
earlier Problem interviews. If you can, also mix in some new people.
Again, test your prototype with <strong><em>at least 5
customers</em></strong></p>
<p>You want to test the following three hypotheses:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<h2>E. Solution Interview Learnings</h2>
<p>After you have conducted your initial interviews, sit together with
your team and discuss the findings. The goal of this conversation is to
determine whether you:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Can identify the demographics of an early adopter</p></li>
<li><p>Have a must-have problem</p></li>
<li><p>Can define the minimum features needed to solve this
problem</p></li>
<li><p>Have a price the customer is willing to pay</p></li>
<li><p>Can build a business around it (using a back-of-the-envelope
calculation)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If this is the case: great! If this is not the case: <strong>don’t
worry</strong>. Many startups find out at this point that their solution
does not fit. That is not bad news. In fact, it has saved you
considerable time and resources because you didn’t make a shiny finished
product but just a simple mockup.</p>
