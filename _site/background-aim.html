<div id="what-is-entrepreneurship" class="section level2">
<h2>What is Entrepreneurship?</h2>
<p>Longtime Harvard Business School Professor Howard Stevenson, who
jumpstarted the study of entrepreneurship in the 1980s, defined
entrepreneurship as: “[The] pursuit of opportunity beyond resources
currently controlled.” Simply establishing a new enterprise is not
enough. Succesful entrepreneurship requires <strong><em>value
creation</em></strong> – some group of customers must be made better off
by the product, service, or platform you are building. Then, the most
direct test of whether customers are made better off is whether they are
willing to pay a positive price (ideally more than your costs!). This is
what economist call <strong>willingness to pay (WTP)</strong>. If
customers WTP &gt; costs of production, then you have created positive
value.</p>
<p>Successful entrepreneurship also involves <strong><em>value
capture</em></strong> – the ability to realize personal value (financial
and otherwise) from establishing and operating a new venture. Value
capture is usually measured in terms of profitability – receiving
revenues from customers in excess of the total costs of serving those
customers. Capturing value means that businesses must create value in a
way that cannot easily (or quickly) be imitated (or improved upon) by
potential competitors. And because value capture is
<strong>necessary</strong> for the company to survive in the long term
(otherwise the firm will go bankrupt and all value is destroyed!), the
economic return to a venture is more than simply its level of sales.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/value_creation_capture.png" alt="Value creation and capture" width="50%" />
<p class="caption">
Value creation and capture
</p>
</div>
<p>As you probably already have noticed, while this sounds good in
theory, the difficult part is putting the theory into practice. How do
you create value? For whom are you creating value? Do your potential
customers really value what you offer? How will you transfer value
created to your customer? How will you capture value? What are your
costs? Which price should you ask? These are all questions an
entrepreneur needs to answer in order to build a successful
business.</p>
<p>The traditional way of approaching these questions was to treat
startups and new ventures as small copies of large businesses.
Entrepreneurs would write long business plans with detailed explanations
of the product, market research, and financial forecasts. The problem
is: this is a recipe for failure. This is because of two main
reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong><em>Uncertainty</em></strong> – Unlike established
businesses, startups do not have a proven track record to rely on. This
basically means that everything is an <strong>assumption</strong>.
Startups do not yet know who their customer is or what their product
should be. As the world becomes more uncertain it becomes harder and
harder to predict the future. Planning and forecasting are only accurate
when based on a long, stable operating history and a relatively static
environment. Startups have neither. This means that only one of your
assumptions needs to be false to make the whole plan break down. That is
an enormous risk. As Steve Blank uses to say: “No one besides venture
capitalists and the late Soviet Union requires five-year plans to
forecast complete unknowns. These plans are generally fiction, and
dreaming them up is almost always a waste of time.” Furthermore,
business plans rarely survive first contact with customers. As the boxer
Mike Tyson once said about his opponents’ prefight strategies:
“Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Limited resources</em></strong> – Faced with this
extreme uncertainty, some entrepreneurs and investors have adopted a
“Just Do It” approach. If traditional methods of planning fail, chaos is
the answer. This doesn’t work either, for the simple reason that most
startups only have limited resources (financially and non-financially).
Just going with a process of undirected trial-and-error will most likely
lead you to run out of resources before finding an answer to the above
questions..</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="aim" class="section level2">
<h2>Aim</h2>
<p>This assignment is all about finding an answer to the questions of
how to create and capture value under conditions of extreme uncertainty
and limited resources. In particular, the aim of the assignment is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Develop a sustainable and scalable business model centered around a
discipline-related innovation through a process of validated
learning</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s break this down:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Business Model</strong> – A business model describes the
rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value.
It is an integrated array of distinctive choices specifying a new
venture’s unique customer value proposition and how it will configure
activities – including those of its partners – to deliver that value and
earn sustainable profits. Think of a business model as a drawing that
shows all the flows between the different parts of your company. A
business model diagram also shows how the product gets distributed to
your customers and how money flows back into your company. The good
thing about business models is that they show the underlying
assumptions: Who are the customers/users? What’s the distribution
channel. How do we price and position the product? How do we create end
user demand? Who are our partners? Where/how do we build the product?
How do we finance the company, etc. A large part of the assignment will
revolve around translating these assumptions into <strong><em>testable
hypotheses</em></strong> to verify whether they are true or
false.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sustainable</strong> – This means different things.
First, we focus on business models that do not need to rely on external
financing injections eternally <em>by design</em>. E.g., offering
medicine for free to inhabitants of low-income neighborhoods is a noble
task but not a sustainable business model as you capture zero value and
can only survive by relying on subsidies. Second, sustainable means that
we are not interested in business models that revolve around <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking"><em>rent-seeking</em></a>;
merely capturing uncompensated value from others without making any
contribution to productivity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scalable</strong> – Entrepreneurship often describes a
small business whose owner starts up a company – i.e. a plumbing supply
store, a restaurant, a consulting firm. Many small businesses are the
backbone of most developing and developed economies. But small
businesses startups have very different objectives than scalable
startups. A “scalable startup” takes an innovative idea and searches for
a scalable and repeatable business model that will turn it into a high
growth, profitable company. It does that by entering a large market and
taking share away from incumbents or by creating a new market and
growing it rapidly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Discipline-related innovation</strong> – Research teaches
us that entrepreneurs working on a product that is related to their
personal experience have an advantage. This is because they have a much
better picture of the benefits and challenges of the technology, as well
as of the industry landscape. Furthermore, experience is typically
necessary to know how to build your product. For example, a physicist is
much better equipped than a software programmer to see opportunities in
the landscape of laser technology. We want you to exploit this
advantage.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Validated learning</strong> – Startups exist not just to
make stuff, make money, or even serve customers. The exist to
<em>learn</em> how to build a sustainable business. This learning can be
validated scientifically by running frequent experiments that allow
entrepreneurs to test each element of their vision. In particular, a
major part of this assignment will require you to “get out of the
building” and test your hypotheses with (potential) customers.</p></li>
